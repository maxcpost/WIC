# WIC 
Version-1.0

A database of information regarding the threat of security on medical devices. As we progress towards a future of interconected devices via BlueTooth, WiFi, etc. the threat of these devices being hacked becomes more real. The purpose of WIC is to provide information of the security status of a multitude of medical devices in order to aid you in making a Well Informed Choice on the products that you use.

### Cardiac Defibrillators/Pacemakers <a id="chapter-1"></a>
<hr>
<!-- Summary -->
<p>
    a device implantable inside the body, able to perform cardioversion, defibrillation, and (in modern versions) pacing of the heart. The device is therefore capable of correcting most life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The ICD is the first-line treatment and prophylactic therapy for patients at risk for sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.[1] Current devices can be programmed to detect abnormal heart rhythms and deliver therapy via programmable antitachycardia pacing in addition to low-energy and high-energy shocks.

    Rating: :star::star::star:

    This device was researched by our team and we can up with a three star rating. This is due impart by the incredable popularity of this device which makes it much larger target for hackers/terorists looking to do harm. It was moderatly easy to

### Cochlear Implants <a id="chapter-2"></a>
<hr>
<!-- Summary -->
<p>
    a surgically implanted electronic device that provides a sense of sound to a person who is profoundly deaf or severely hard of hearing in both ears; as of 2014 they had been used experimentally in some people who had acquired deafness in one ear after learning how to speak. Cochlear implants bypass the normal hearing process; they have a microphone and some electronics that reside outside the skin, generally behind the ear, which transmits a signal to an array of electrodes placed in the cochlea, which stimulate the cochlear nerve.

    Rating: :star::star::star::star:

    The device was given 4 stars due to the unpopularity of the product aswell as there being very little risk. The actul security of the divice is generally sub-par. The risk of a hacked device could be hearing damage to a broken device.

### Deep Brain Neurostimulators <a id="chapter-3"></a>
<hr>
<!-- Summary -->
<p>
    the purposeful modulation of the nervous system's activity using invasive (e.g. microelectrodes) or non-invasive means (e.g. transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial electric stimulation, tES, such as tDCS or transcranial alternating current stimulation, tACS). Neurostimulation usually refers to the electromagnetic approaches to neuromodulation.

### Gastric Stimulators <a id="chapter-5"></a>
<hr>
<!-- Summary -->
<p>
    a pacemaker-like device with electrical connections to the surface of the stomach. These devices are for treatment of gastroparesis. This device works by disrupting of the motility cycle or stimulating enteric nervous system. The machine provides electric stimulation to the stomach. It is used to decrease the duration of satiety. The machine has been called a gastric pacer. There are approximately 4,000 gastric pacer surgeries a year in the United States.

### Insulin Pumps <a id="chapter-6"></a>
<hr>
<!-- Summary -->
<p>
    a medical device used for the administration of insulin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, also known as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy. The device configuration may vary depending on design. It is an alternative to multiple daily injections of insulin by insulin syringes or an insulin pen and allows for intensive insulin therapy when used in conjunction with blood glucose monitoring and carb counting.
